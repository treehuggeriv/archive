## Progress
- Goal: Ability to exert one's own abilities to their full potential, freedom to effect change
  - Control and discipline as ultimate goal since that's the only thing that really matters in the long term
- Making progress in face of hesitation:
    - The answers to the issues you're giving are the concerns of an overly neurotic dude that's afraid of inconveniencing others or getting rejected.
    - There's a saying for the British special forces; "[he] who dares, wins".
    - The real answer is to not give a fuck how you're perceived, and just do what you gotta do to get what you want. There has to be an element of testicular fortitude where you just go out and impose your will on the dating market.
- Worrying is an indulgence, could be thought of a time waster which comforts you momentarily but doesn't actually make you take any action
- Lost and directionless?
    - Our most radical changes in perspective often happen at the tail end of our worst moments. It’s only when we feel intense pain that we’re willing to look at our values and question why they seem to be failing us. We need some sort of existential crisis to take an objective look at how we’ve been deriving meaning in our life, and then consider changing course. 
    - You could call it “hitting bottom” or “having an existential crisis.” I prefer to call it “weathering the shitstorm.” Choose what suits you.
    - And perhaps you’re in that kind of place right now. Perhaps you’re coming out of the most significant challenge of your life and are bewildered because everything you previously thought to be true and normal and good has turned out to be the opposite. 
    - That’s good—that’s the beginning. I can’t stress this enough,
    - enough, but pain is part of the process. It’s important to feel it. Because if you just chase after highs to cover up the pain, if you continue to indulge in entitlement and delusional positive thinking, if you continue to overindulge in various substances or activities, then you’ll never generate the requisite motivation to actually change.
    - (Subtle Art)
- Mindset when dealing with setbacks: Foolish as I am, at least I am willing to bear the weight of my suffering.
  - Responsibility gives meaning to life
  - JP
- The cost of choice: Maturity comes at the cost of losing pluripotency of childhood but for something solid. But you'll have to mature eventually so it's better to choose what your specialization and limitations are then to let them be chosen for you.
  - Sacrifice is inevitable but choice isn't so choose your sacrifice.
  - JP


## Perspective
- Remember, everyone has their fair share of problems (e.g., distrust of partners for the wealthy) Grass is always greener on the other side
- Uncertainty is a built-in part of life, need to learn how to take it easy and have fun despite this uncertainty; this is the essence of "being fun"
  - Hence, have to take yourself less seriously and not get bitter when things don't work out
  - Still need to know how to get serious when you need to (e.g., for work) but should be able to relax during off times
- Go live in a country (e.g., India, China) for a while in an intimate community to see that they can exhibit all the same characteristics as other nationalities
  - This will decrease prejudice since the first prejudicial thoughts of people of said country will be replaced by those formed during the experience of living in this country
- If any could desire what he is incapable of possessing, despair is his eternal lot

  
## Comparison:
- Nietzsche - better to be truthful about what you want than twist your personality to avoid discomfort  
  - Must be strong enough to face and stay honest about our own misfortunes 
- SoL - Should look at what provokes envy from you in other people, these are qualities that you want in yourself and hence tell you what you should be working towards
  - Don't hate or make greater individuals less than what they are, learn from them 
- Rochefoucauld - Great men are often made more by luck than of his own ability; some qualities may be due to chance, but doesn't give excuse for you to not try to create the same type of circumstances for yourself 
- Complications of comparing yourself too often with those out of reach: And when you feel like you’re losing too often, you will become impatient and you will start taking shortcuts or reach for external stuff that masks the pain of losing
- Excessive comparison to others will limit how far you can reach due to the lack of apparent progress when you look back 
  - Instead, looking back on your previous self is more conducive to growth 
  - Thus, use others as a long term goal and previous self as short term

## Politics
- Alpha male position is determined by the size and stability of his coalition (i.e., those that support him) rather than upon his strength alone 
  - Hence, power should be gained by forming ties with others rather than purely through technical strength - Sapiens 
  - Technical strength can serve as a bridge to forming ties as you can occupy coveted positions based on others needs of which only you can fulfill due to your ability 
	

    
# Technical 
## Meta-learning
- Black box approach to learning things is to learn the basic inputs/outputs (or an abstraction of the concept)
  - Use that to build subsequent pieces of knowledge so that your ignorance doesn't slow you down from learning big concepts
  - Sometimes only a bit of information about a certain topic is needed to use this component as a semantic building block so black boxing represents a more efficient way to learn complex concepts
- Active recall/spaced repetition only works if you've already encoded the information correctly
  - If you haven't encoded info, there's really nothing to recall (garbage in, garbage out)


## Productivity 
- Have list of curious reading that you can do when having a mental block
  - But keep expectations low to keep threshold of effort low
- Need implementation intentions for change 
  - Create contingencies based on common obstacles to ensure all cases are covered
  - E.g., Must have clear plan of what to do when getting out of bed, otherwise it makes getting up difficult
- Where good ideas come from: 
  - Let’s get one thing clear right now, shall we? There is no Idea Dump, no Story Central, no Island of the Buried Bestsellers; good story ideas seem to come quite literally from nowhere, sailing at you right out of the empty sky: two previously unrelated ideas come together and make something new under the sun. Your job isn’t to find these ideas but to recognize them when they show up.
  - On Writing by Stephen King
- How to Wake Up the Muse: 
  - There is a muse, but he’s not going to come fluttering down into your writing room and scatter creative fairy-dust all over your typewriter or computer station. He lives in the ground. He’s a basement guy. You have to descend to his level, and once you get down there you have to furnish an apartment for him to live in. You have to do all the grunt labor, in other words, while the muse sits and smokes cigars and admires his bowling trophies and pretends to ignore you. Do you think this is fair? I think it’s fair. He may not be much to look at, that muse-guy, and he may not be much of a conversationalist (what I get out of mine is mostly surly grunts, unless he’s on duty), but he’s got the inspiration. It’s right that you should do all the work and burn all the midnight oil, because the guy with the cigar and the little wings has got a bag of magic. There’s stuff in there that can change your life.

## AI/ML
- Similar to learning intricacies of interpreting AIC and BIC for LCA, mastery of ML may involve knowing how to interpret performance measures for accuracy (i.e., how to tell from learning curves and other performance metrics if recall is actually relevant) 
  - Beyond this, a useful skill would be knowing how to tweak training such that it requires less data (i.e., knowing which parts of the training data are critical) 
- Gradient descent/ascent is just a numerical solution to find global optimal, just that in ML they use it for cost functions
	Numerical in the context of analytical vs numerical 
## Research Generic
- Strength of using big data is that you can look at heterogeneity and subpopulations with granular detail in comparison to smaller data sets where heterogeneity is an inherent limitation
- Why do drugs targeting a specific mechanism often not get the effect that you're looking for in theory (or only get a reduced version of it?):
  - Probably because there's more than one mechanism contributing to the outcome you're trying to improve and there also may be extra compensatory mechanisms

## Entrepreneuship 
- For startups: have to start working out as a consultant, then once you have enough connections/industry knowledge, can think of own company to start
- Don't rush to do startup, need the right timing
  - Only takes 5 good years of work to form something large. 
- Hiring right people is probably the most important part
- Core part of your team you should know well - can do this by keeping in touch with them throughout the years e.g., quarterly checkups
- But remember that to retain value, you need to have something that you bring to the table as well

# Rhetoric Wisdom
## Conversation
- Exchanges of platitudes is not a conversation - shallow conversations follow this
  - Should talk about own experiences and knowledge instead of domain of cliches 
- Basis of building connections is emotions: Eliciting emotions that the person wants to express at the time (e.g., fears, happiness) seems most optimal for building connection 
  - But people will only express deeper emotions if they feel socially safe (e.g., other person is genuine and won't betray them)
  - Long-lasting intimate bonds are built on vulnerability as it implies that both parties share human fallibility
  - Shouldn't only share success but also their secrets, doubts, fears, and past mistakes to build shared vulnerability 
- During conversation to make it more personalized point out aspects that are odd or slightly more notable than normal. For example, little idiosyncrasies since everyone has these. Then make a reasonable assumption off of it that you can play with. 
  - For example " there was a lot of hesitation in You answering that you're a engineer? Are you sure you graduated?". And continue along the slide by further assumptions: the principal is that if this is true then what else is true?
  - The assumption or reasoning following the observation doesn't necessarily have to be funny, it just needs to be interesting. Being witty or insightful in these assumptions is the goal. Don't always try to be hilarious or else you will come up as too try hard
- The goal for a cold approach is to find an observation that will link to a conversation topic which generates the most amount of child conversation topic threats that you are comfortable with. 
  - For example at event trying to make an observation which tempts the other party to talk to you about their career trajectory or perhaps their interests in a certain area that you are knowledgeable in will likely be most actionable
- The key to being interesting is involving unique specific details that draw the listeners attention. The more general the conversation the less people will pay to it since (it's less interesting)
  - This also ties into depth: the more specific you get, the more depth you can incorporate into a description and therefore the more intriguing something will be
- Conversations should always incorporate a story which is composed of the following elements: what happened, the intervention, the resolution and the change
- Can lead conversation through storytelling. E.g., 100% perfect girl one beautiful April morning story (Haruki-murakami) as a way to say that fate doesn't work by itself. You have to seize the moment
  - Basically story goes: both see each other in the village supermarket and have a moment but decide to leave it up to fate to see if they ever meet up again and if they do did meet up again then they would decide to get married. They were excited the first day but with each passing day they got less excited. Years go by and eventually they forget about it. Then a flu hits the village and they both end up in the hospital on opposite wings. One day there are both walking down hallway and again make contact with each other and have a vague recollection of their previous spark, but then walk right past each other because too much has changed since the original moment
- Every positive has a negative and vice versa (e.g., emphasis on integrity usually is because there has been dishonesty in the past)



## Presentation  
- Increase appeal of research presentations: Have a demo as main attraction with QR code accessible to a link for actual data if people are interested (since most people don't really look at the data in detail) 
- Analogies as a way to explain ideas
  - Analogy or story to tie it together and keep on referring to it throughout the presentation to keep it cohesive. 
  - The more similar the concept is to what you're trying to present, the more references you can make. 
  - The more common and well understood the analogy the higher the power of convincing

## Debate 
- The strongest antidote to denial is the legitimation of fear. The way you prevent people from going into denial is to allow them to be afraid. Give them permission to be afraid. Make it legitimate to be afraid. If people feel that fear is inappropriate, they might try to get down to apathy. But if they're scared, they're scared and they can't make themselves apathetic but they can go into denial.

- How to tell if someone will be willing to change their mind: should ask what sort of evidence would make them change their mind - and they should pause and think about it critically, if they don't, then they're probably not even willing to change their mind 
- Sometimes there isn't a truth that can be analyzed objectively (i.e., the hypothetical data is impractical to obtain)
  - In this case, better to entertain multiple opinions and sides because the truth probably lies in between (e.g., politics) 


# Relationship
- Attraction for women tend to rely more on AUC of emotional responses rather than stats
  - Everyone wants to feel desired; should always compliment on good things you notice rather than assuming that you notice them
  - A good conversation does not necessarily mean emotional connection
  - E.g., I have great conversation with my barber. Do I want to fuck him? No. Great conversation isn't enough and in fact its expected that any functioning pair of adults should be able to converse and find commonalities.
  - Thinking back on those dates again, not once did I tell them they were pretty, not once did I attempt to be any amount of flirtatious, not once did I show any amount of spine or confidence in myself. Even if they don't want to go home with you on that first date, they at least know you are interested and sure of yourself. Don't be disgusting about it, but giving compliments, flirting, showing confidence and assuredness will go a long way.
- Flirtation seems to be a subset of interactions that involve emotions (may start with personal info, but the crux of it is emotion)
  - Good chemistry/connection may really just be that you elicit good emotions (i.e., emotions that make the other person feel good in general or about themselves) from the other person 
  - An additional sexual dimension is added for flirtations in that emotional connections are made on a subject that involves sex and arousal - this seems to be the area with the most impact 
  - A good opener should land you comfortably within emotional strata, can work way into sexual afterwards since starting off with that may be too awkward
- Control over sex is a significant point of leverage 
  - Many of their actions can be derived from this (e.g., makeup, dresses) 
  - You can liberate yourself you don't seek what they have
- Incorrect generalizations come out of inexperience in the field
  - No homogeneous genders exist in the world, should try exploring before lumping everyone together 
  - When you truly come to accept that everyone has differences, you will start to see the true variation in the world for what it is instead of trying to cram everything into a single explanation
  - Catering to a trend often doesn't work well when you're dealing with an individual (i.e., everyone differs from the general trend and you need to account for this)
  - "Men who try to date "women" and women who try to date "men" keep getting disappointed,"
  - Treat all genders as individuals first rather than member of that gender (i.e., be curious about them rather than tag them as an object with a label)
- Looks vs other aspects for courtship:
  - I don’t know how you can see so many examples of guys like Biggie Smalls and Ralphie May (RIP), who pulled hot women and think that looks are everything. Typically if you’re THAT GUY in whatever social setting, women will work to become your girl because then they get acknowledged as THAT BITCH who pulled THEE GUY. 
  - Think about it like this, women would rather marry the King and become Queen than they would sleep with the hottest pauper. And men would rather sleep with the hottest female pauper, than marry the ugly ass Queen and not even be King, but rather just some guy who married the ugly ass Queen.
- Are you getting leftovers since they couldn’t get who they really wanted?:
  - I don't get the question. All men are betabuxxed in a way or another. Even some chads are used by women as prize husbands to cause envy to other female friends.
  - The key is to give as much as she gives you, and everyone wins.
  - Everyone settles in some aspect 
  - Know your own worth and don't try to deviate too far from it when asking
- Don't pay too much attention to M aesthetics since XX aesthetics will start to influence you more as a side effect

# On meditation 
- Decision maker of whether to leave Meditation with insights runs sort of as a low level program that always evaluates the value of the idea vs that of continuing the meditation
- Meditation as forced insight generator? 
  - Focus on one core aspect of a problem, keep reiterating on it mentally with each breath and mind will naturally wander around it and generate ideas for you
- Meditation as way to reset mind instinctively (e.g., for reminding of long term goals when mind is clouded by short term circumstances)
  - But would first need to turn meditation into an instinctive habit so that relying on it for reset becomes possible

- Rudyard Kipling's "If", on how to perceive both success and failures:
	If you can keep your head when all about you   
		Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,   
	If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
		But make allowance for their doubting too;   
	If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
		Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,
	Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,
		And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:
	
	If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;   
		If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;   
	If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
		And treat those two impostors just the same;   
	If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken
		Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
	Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
		And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools:
	
	If you can make one heap of all your winnings
		And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
	And lose, and start again at your beginnings
		And never breathe a word about your loss;
	If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
		To serve your turn long after they are gone,   
	And so hold on when there is nothing in you
		Except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’
	
	If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,   
		Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
	If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
		If all men count with you, but none too much;
	If you can fill the unforgiving minute
		With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,   
	Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,   
	And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!
