## Progress
- Goal: Ability to exert one's own abilities to their full potential, freedom to effect change
  - Control and discipline as ultimate goal since that's the only thing that really matters in the long term
- Making progress in face of hesitation:
    - The answers to the issues you're giving are the concerns of an overly neurotic dude that's afraid of inconveniencing others or getting rejected.
    - There's a saying for the British special forces; "[he] who dares, wins".
    - The real answer is to not give a fuck how you're perceived, and just do what you gotta do to get what you want. There has to be an element of testicular fortitude where you just go out and impose your will on the dating market.
- Worrying is an indulgence, could be thought of a time waster which comforts you momentarily but doesn't actually make you take any action
- Lost and directionless?
    - Our most radical changes in perspective often happen at the tail end of our worst moments. It’s only when we feel intense pain that we’re willing to look at our values and question why they seem to be failing us. We need some sort of existential crisis to take an objective look at how we’ve been deriving meaning in our life, and then consider changing course. 
    - You could call it “hitting bottom” or “having an existential crisis.” I prefer to call it “weathering the shitstorm.” Choose what suits you.
    - And perhaps you’re in that kind of place right now. Perhaps you’re coming out of the most significant challenge of your life and are bewildered because everything you previously thought to be true and normal and good has turned out to be the opposite. 
    - That’s good—that’s the beginning. I can’t stress this enough,
    - enough, but pain is part of the process. It’s important to feel it. Because if you just chase after highs to cover up the pain, if you continue to indulge in entitlement and delusional positive thinking, if you continue to overindulge in various substances or activities, then you’ll never generate the requisite motivation to actually change.
